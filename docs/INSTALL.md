# Installing BTCRecover #

There are a few basic steps to installing BTCRecover.

1) Download and unzip the BTCRecover script

2) Download and install Python3

3) Install required packages via Python PIP

4) (Optional) Install PyOpenCL module for GPU Acceleration

5) Test your installation (Optional, but a good idea)

These steps are covered in more detail below. [If you prefer a video walkthrough, can be found on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/8q65eqpf4gE](https://youtu.be/8q65eqpf4gE)

**Note: Depending on your operating system and python environment, you may need to replace the `python` command with `python3`. (By default, the command to use will be `python` in Windows and `python3` in Linux) Most non-technical users are on Windows, so all example commands will use `python` to match the defaults for this platform** 

## 1) Downloading *btcrecover* ##

Just download the latest version from <https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/archive/master.zip> and unzip it to a location of your choice. There’s no installation procedure for *btcrecover* itself, however there are additional requirements below depending on your operating system and the wallet type you’re trying to recover.


## 2) Install Python ##

**Note:** Only Python 3.6 and later are officially supported... BTCRecover is automatically tested with all supported Python versions (3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9) on all supported environments (Windows, Linux, Mac), so you can be sure that both BTCRecover and all required packages will work correctly. Some features of BTCRecover may work on earlier versions of Python, your best bet is to use run-all-tests.py to see what works and what doesn't...

### Windows ###
Video Demo of Installing BTCRecover in Ubuntu Live USB: <https://youtu.be/8q65eqpf4gE>

Visit the Python download page here: <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>, and click the link for the latest **Python 3.9** release (Python 3.10, etc, will work, but Python 3.9 has simpler installation of required modules) release near the top of the page under the heading *Python Releases for Windows*. Download and run either the `Windows x86 MSI installer` for the 32-bit version of Python, or the `Windows x86-64 MSI installer` for the 64-bit one. Modern PCs should use the 64-bit version, however if you're unsure which one is compatible with your PC, choose the 32-bit one.

_**When installing Python in Windows, be sure to select to "Add Python 3.9 to PATH" on the first screen of the installer...**_

**Note for Large Multi-CPU Systems:** Windows limits the number of possible threads to 64. If your system has more logical/physical cores than this, your best bet is to run the tool in Linux. (Ubuntu is an easy place to start)

### Linux ###

Most modern distributions include Python 3 pre-installed. Older Linux distributions will include Python2, so you will need to install python3.

If you are using SeedRecover, you will also need to install tkinter (python3-tk) if you want to use the default GUI popups for seedrecover. (Command line use will work find without this package)

Some distributions of Linux will bundle this with Python3, but for others like Ubuntu, you will need to manually install the tkinter module.

You can install this with the command: `sudo apt install python3-tk`

If any of the "pip3" commands below fail, you may also need to install PIP via the command: `sudo apt install python3-pip`

If you get a message that there is no installation candidate for Python3-pip, you will need to enable the "universe" repository with the command: `sudo add-apt-repository universe`

You can then re-run the command to install python3-pip from above.

### MacOS ###

While MacOS will happily install python3 on demand, it's likely that you will need some additional packages to be able to build modules like coincurve.

1) [Install brew via instructions at brew.sh](https://brew.sh)
   
The Install command is:  

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

_Be sure to follow the instructions and add brew to your path..._
   
2) [Install coincurve build requirements](https://ofek.dev/coincurve/install/) 
   
The Install command is:

    xcode-select --install
    brew install autoconf automake libffi libtool pkg-config python

## 3) Install requirements via Python Pip ##

Once both Python3 and PIP have been installed, you can automatically install all the requirements for all features of BTCRecover with the command:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

*If you are an advanced user, you may choose to install only those additional packages that are required for the specific recovery you are attempting. More information about which wallets require which packages is at the bottom of this guide.*

## 4) Install PyOpenCL for GPU Acceleration ##

GPU Support will require additional OpenCL libraries to be installed that aren't covered by the above commands... 

For more information and instructions, [see the GPU acceleration page here](./GPU_Acceleration.md)

## 5) Testing your Installation ##

Once you have downloaded and unzipped BTCRecover, installed Python and all required libraries, you can test the program with the command:

`python run-all-tests.py -vv`

This command will take a few minutes to run and should complete without errors, indicating that your system is ready to use all features of BTCRecover.

## PyCryptoDome ##

With the exception of Ethereum wallets, PyCryptoDome is not strictly required for any wallet, however it offers a 20x speed improvement for wallets that tag it as recommended in the list above.

### Windows ###

PyCryptoDome support is provided via the pycryptodome module. This can be installed via PIP.

### Linux ###

Many distributions include PyCrypto pre-installed, check your distribution’s package management system to see if it is available (it is often called “python3-pycryptodome”). If not, try installing it from PyPI, for example on Debian-like distributions (including Ubuntu), if this doesn't work:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pycryptodome

then try this instead:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install pycryptodome

### OS X ###

 1. Open a terminal window (open the Launchpad and search for "terminal"). Type this and then choose `Install` to install the command line developer tools:

        xcode-select --install

 2. Type this to install PyCryptoDome

        sudo pip3 install pycryptodome


## Google Protocol Buffers ##

### Windows ###

Open a command prompt window, and type this to install Google Protocol Buffers:

    pip3 install protobuf

##### Linux #####

Install the Google's Python protobuf library, for example on Debian-like distributions (including Ubuntu), open a terminal window and type this:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install protobuf

### OS X ###

 1. Open a terminal window (open the Launchpad and search for "terminal"). Type this and then choose `Install` to install the command line developer tools:

        xcode-select --install

 2. Type this to install Google Protocol Buffers:

        sudo pip3 install protobuf

----------


[PyCryptoDome](#pycryptodome) is also recommended for Bitcoin Core or Litecoin-Qt wallets for a 2x speed improvement.
